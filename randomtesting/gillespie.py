# To calculate waiting time and progression of events

# 1) Given state of the system, calculate rates for every possible event that can occur.
# 2) Use a random number to determine which event does occur (patches_weighted_random.py).
# 3) Use the sum of all the rates to calculate the time increment.
# 4) Update time and state of the system given the event that occurred.
# 5) Return to 1.
